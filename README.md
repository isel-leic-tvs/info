#### Description
Software deployment and execution frequently relies on virtualized computing environments, where the virtualization occurs in different levels and forms. In one of its most basic occurrences, operating systems generally allow multiple programs to execute simultaneously in (somehow) isolated environments called processes, where a program in execution appears to have a computing environment for itself. Some operating systems also offer the possibility of running software originally produced to run in a system with a very different microprocessor. In other cases, they allow running software programs designed for a different operating system.
